Steps for successfully using GitHub:
1. At the start of each time period you are working on the project, PULL the project from Git. 
  To do this, go to the Git tab in the top right box and click on the blue down arrow.
  This is important to make sure you always have the most recent version of the project file.
2. Once finished working on the project for a session, commit and push your changes.
  To do this, check the boxes next to the files in the top right box and click Commit. In the new window, type a short commit message detailing what you hace changed and click Commit again. Once this is finished, click the green push arrow to push the project back out to Git. 
  This is important to be able to get all your changes back to your group members.
  
Some other guidelines:
  Put all library calls in the "r setup" code chunk at the top of the file
  Add comments to your code so that other group members can easily tell what each bit of code does
